# This is a simple project aimed at creating an API (Application Programming Interface) 
# using python fastapi module to to perform tasks like accessing, retrieving, listing, 
# updating and deleting the data present in the cloud database. It can be tested directly
# in the browser of choice using inbuilt swagger api or it can be convenient to use dedicated
# api testing applications like postman, SoapUi, RestAssured, etc.
